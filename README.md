## How To chance CSS and other things

Notice for developers:

Since 1.4.9 i moved the SASS-Code into /src/sass and added a gulpfile for 
- building CSS files 
    run with: `gulp dev` for an unminified dev version and 
    `gulp build` for the minified version for the productive website
- performing a css validation test
    `gulp dev`   will report the css validation; Or use
    `gulp validatecss`
- update version numbers
    - `gulp dev` or  `gulp devversion`  will update the version number to a 
      subpatch dev level number
    - `gulp dev` or  `gulp upversionpatch`  will update the version number to a 
      patch level number
-  upate the pot file
    `gulp pot`   will update the language index 

To make it work, you habe to install npm on your computer and make a 
   `npm install -save-dev`
    into the working directory of your theme files.

If you need to, you could add a css watcher or add also the the gulp script to
merge all js files. 

If you chance something in the code, please perform a version update.
Make a `gulp dev` as long you are working in your own repo. Once you commit it to
the main repo, please do a `gulp build` . This will update the version number in
an automatic way.
